Computer Organisation and Hardware Engineering

## Course content:

The course is divided into six different modules, which for example include the following basic concepts:

- C-programming and assembler language: pointers, functions, stack, assembly language, machine language, instruction encoding and processor registers.
- I/O system: timers, interrupts and memory mapped I/O.
- Digital design: truth tables, gates, boolean algebra, multiplexers, decoders, adders, combinatorial nets, sequential networks and registers.
- Processor construction: arithmetic-logic unit, data path, control unit and pipeline.
- Memory architectures: instruction cache, data cache and virtual memory.
- Parallel processors and programs: Amdahl's law, different variants of parallelism as well as multicore.

## Learning outcomes:

- Implement low-level programs in the C programming language and in an assembly language
- Implement low-level programs with input-output, timers, and interrupts
- Analyse processor microarchitectures, with and without a pipeline,
- Analyse memory hierarchies, including cache-structures.
- Compare fundamental concepts about multiprocessor computers.
- Explain and describe technical solutions both orally and in writing.

- Each group should consist of 2 students. Should be the same as the lab groups.
- Student groups may collaborate, i.e., projects may be connected.
- You must use the ChipKIT hardware and you may add additional hardware components.
- Each group can borrow a hardware kit for free!
- Either you do a basic project or an advanced project (required to be able to get grades A or B)
- More info will come on lecture 6. See also the course web.
- 307 students registerd on the course
